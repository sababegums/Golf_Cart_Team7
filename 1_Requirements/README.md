# GOLF-KART

# HISTORY
- Reportedly, the first use of a motorized cart on a golf course was by JK Wadley of Texarkana, Texas/Arkansas, who saw a three-wheeled electric cart being used in Los Angeles to transport senior citizens to the grocery store. Later, he purchased a cart and found that it worked poorly on a golf course.The first electric golf cart was custom-made in 1932, but did not gain widespread acceptance. In the 1930s until the 1950s the most widespread use of golf carts was for those with disabilities who could not walk far. By the mid 1950s the golf cart had gained wide acceptance with US golfers, with several manufactures (e.g. Victor Adding Machine Co. and Sears Roebuck) producing various models. Most were electric.
# ABSTRACT
- In this paper, the Design & Calculations of an Electric golf cart is done, the calculations and process to develop a golf cart chassis, electrical transmission using transaxle, braking, steering geometry, suspension system, solar panel of a long six seat golf cart, battery calculations and controller which monitors the electric system is explained. All the materials used  for the calculation are industry standard being utilized currently. Priority of this design was to keep the cart as light weight as possible and rigid with good performance on grassy and concrete terrain’s used in either golf course or in hospitality education sectors. A unique tubular chassis is used in the design comprising of circular & rectangular shape. The focus of design was long mileage from the batteries used and how much, adding solar panels can contribute to the existing range of the electric vehicle. A 23 miles range from the battery pack using 6 deep cycle lead acid batteries was achieved and increased12 miles from the solar panels under the constraint assumed for its use (direct sunlight for over 6-7 hours)

## Key words:
- electric golf cart, design, Electric vehicle, electric transmission, vehicle design, battery calculation, solar golf cart.

# INTRODUCTION 
- This projects aim is to Design an electric golf cart with six people seating capacity which runs on batteries as  well as solar panels. The need for a golf cart isn’t just using it in the golf course and is nowadays being used in large universities spread over vast acres of land and in expensive hotels and latest complexes for comfort traveling i.e Hospitality industry and providing low cost of charging with increasing mileage as technology advances. In this project the aim has been to put forth an industry standard design for an electric golf cart that can run exceedingly well on grassy / muddy terrains as well as wet conditions and concrete roads. During designing all the constraints and cost considerations and all technical aspects were set according to the current advancements in the industry in a thoroughly researched manner. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) has far fewer moving parts than a conventional gasoline-powered vehicle. There’s no need for a liquid fuels or oil changes. There’s no transmission or timing belt to fail you. And most of the maintenance cost associated with ic engine are eliminated.

- Golf carts use a series of batteries that supply the needed voltage and amperage, so size and power requirements are key features for a replacement. Be aware that golf carts do not use a single battery, but multiples of 6V, 8V, or 12V batteries. Ensure any replacement batteries you purchase use the same combination. Do not upgrade your batteries over the manufacturer's recommendations, which can ruin your cart. Match the brand standard to the standard on your replacement battery packs. The wrong battery can waste money, a hazardous situation, and any combination in between.
